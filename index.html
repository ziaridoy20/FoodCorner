    <h1> Food Corner`s Food Quality </h1>
    
    <p>
    Food quality is an important food manufacturing requirement,
    because food consumers are susceptible to any form of
    contamination that may occur during the manufacturing process.
    Many consumers also rely on manufacturing and processing standards, 
    particularly to know what ingredients are present, due to dietary, 
    nutritional requirements (kosher, halal, vegetarian), or medical 
    conditions (e.g., diabetes, or allergies).</p>
    
    <h1> The Story of Food Corner </h1>
    <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
        at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more 
        obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and 
        going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered 
        the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 
        1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
        by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
        very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
        "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
