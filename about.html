        <p> I have been staying in America for eight month.
            After I came to America, I found that so many American like
            to eat Chinese food, so I want to talk about the food in China 
            and America.        
            Maybe many people knew that Chinese food is very famous all over the world.
            Wherever you are, you all can find Chinese restaurant.
            <br> <br>
            
            I know every country has their own food. And with the development 
            of the history, every country has formed its special food which is different
            from other countries. Here I will mainly introduce the difference between 
            Chinese and American food which are totally different styles.
            
            <br> <br>
            

            China is an old country with more than 5000 years’ history. While America 
            only has 200 years’ history . So Chinese food also has a long history,
            there are many traditional food production methods came from the old time. Just like dumpling.
            And many traditional food came from festival, for instance, moon cake.This festival was named mid-autumn festival. This food looks like a moon, and in China,
            people also use moon to describe people's reunion, so when people 
            eats it, means family members can get together. But, in America, I never heard some food have some special meanning.
